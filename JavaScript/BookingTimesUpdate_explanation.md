# Say you are building a booking system.
 So you have an array of hours in a ComboBox for the users to choose arival time.
 After the user chose the arival time and the duration for his stay, you would want to remove the hours which are not available anymore from the comboBox database
 
 timeslotArray is your strings array which contains the available hours, as a database for the comboBox.
 updateArray is the function to remove the no-more-available hours from the array.

 Have fun hacking!
